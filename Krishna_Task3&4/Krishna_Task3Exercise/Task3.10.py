# 10. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generates a list and a tuple
# which contains every number in the form of string.
# Sample input: 34,67,55,33,12,98
# Expected output: [‘34’,’67’,’55’,’33’,’12’,’98’] (‘34’,’67’,’55’,’33’,’12’,’98’)
#
# input_numbers = "34,67,55,33,12,98"
# new_list = input_numbers.split(",")
# new_tuple = tuple(new_list)
# print("New list:", new_list)
# print("New tuple:", new_tuple)
