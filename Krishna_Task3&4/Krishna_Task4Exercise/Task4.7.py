#7. Define a function that can accept two strings as input and print the string with the maximum length
# in the console. If two strings have the same length, then the function should print both the strings line
# by line.

# string1 = input("Enter first string: ")
# string2 = input("Enter second string: ")
# count1 = 0
# count2 = 0
# for i in string1:
#       count1 = count1 + 1
#
# for j in string2:
#       count2 = count2 + 1
#
# if (count1 < count2):
#       print ("Larger string is:")
#       print (string2)
#
# elif (count1 == count2):
#       print(string1)
#       print(string2)
# else:
#       print ("Larger string is:")
#       print (string1)
