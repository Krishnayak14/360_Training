#8.Define a function which can generate and print a tuple where the values are square of numbers
#between 1 and 20 (both 1 and 20 included).

# start = 1
# end = 20
# def square_numbers(first, last):
#     list = []
#     for i in range(first, last):
#         result = i**2
#         list.append(result)
#     tuple_num = tuple(list)
#     return tuple_num
#
# print(square_numbers(start, end+1))
